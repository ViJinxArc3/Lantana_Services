### Deployment

I plan to deploy my application to Vercel. My choice of Vercel is motivated by several factors:

-**Speed and Ease of Deployment:** Vercel provides a fast and easy way to deploy web projects. It offers a streamlined deployment process, allowing me to focus on deployment without the concern of any complex deployment configurations.


-**Global Content Delivery:** Vercel includes a Global CDN (Content Delivery Network), ensuring that my web content can be deliverd to users worldwide with minimal latency. This is crucial for providing a responsive and efficient user experience. 

-**Automatic HTTPS:** Vercel automatically secures my application with HTTPS, enhancing security and trustworthiness.

##Styling

For styling my application, I have chosen a combination of Tailwind CSS and self-coded CSS frameworks. My motivation for this choice is as follows:

-**Tailwind CSS:** I will leverage Tailwind CSS for its utility-first approach to styling, as it provides a highly customizable way to style components.

-**Self-Coded CSS Frameworks:** While Tailwind CSS offers great utility, I have opted to include some self-coded CSS frameworks to provide a unique and customized visual experience. By combining Tailwind CSS and self-coded CSS frameworks, I aim to strike a balance between rapid development and full creative control over my application's design.
